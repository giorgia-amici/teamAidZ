#**WOULD YOU RATHER GAME**

This is an API served on a Node server with AngularJS on the client side.


The main aim of the app is to engage student with their local MPs and PCCs. In order to do that, the student can ask some questions to his/her local candidate (or MP) that will then be notified using Twitter once a set number of questions has been asked. Once the candidate had replied, the answers will be sent back to the student's home page.

The server itself is quite trivial although there are present some aspects (like storage) I will be 
implementing later.
Also the Angular testing part needs to be polished.
