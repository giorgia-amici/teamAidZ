##How it looks in my mind

This is an API served on a Node server with AngularJS as MVC on the client side.

The main aim of the app is to __engage student with their local MPs and PCCs__. In order to do that, the student can ask some questions to his/her local candidate (or MP) that will then be notified using Twitter once a set number of questions has been asked. Once the candidate had replied, the answers will be sent back to the student's home page.


###Future implementation
- Use the twitter API for notifying students and candidates
- The server itself is quite trivial although there are some aspects (like storage) I would like to
implement.
- Use Protractore for E2E tests and implement unit tests.
